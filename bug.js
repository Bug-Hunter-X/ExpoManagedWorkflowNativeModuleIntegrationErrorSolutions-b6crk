This error typically occurs when you're working with Expo's managed workflow and you try to use native modules that aren't properly configured or compatible with the Expo environment.  Expo's managed workflow simplifies development by bundling most of the native code for you, but it has limitations on the native modules you can directly use.  For example, if you're trying to use a React Native module that needs direct access to native iOS or Android code, it might conflict with Expo's managed setup.  The exact error message may vary depending on the specific native module and how you're attempting to integrate it.
