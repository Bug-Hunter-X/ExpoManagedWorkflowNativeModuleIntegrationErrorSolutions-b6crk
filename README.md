# Expo Managed Workflow Native Module Integration Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using native modules within Expo's managed workflow. The error arises from attempting to integrate a module that requires direct access to native code, conflicting with Expo's bundled environment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Attempt to run the app using `expo start`.

The app will fail to load and display an error indicating a problem with native module integration.

## Solution

The solution often involves exploring alternatives:

* **Use an Expo-compatible module:** Search for an equivalent module specifically designed for Expo's managed workflow.  These modules often abstract away the need for direct native interaction.
* **Eject from Expo (not recommended):**  As a last resort, you could eject from Expo's managed workflow to gain full control over the native code. This is generally discouraged, as it significantly increases the complexity of your project and loses many of the benefits of Expo.
* **Use a bridging approach (advanced):** For more complex cases, you might need to create a bridge between JavaScript and your native module.  This requires in-depth understanding of React Native's native modules architecture.

This example showcases the challenges of native module integration within Expo's managed workflow and provides solutions to address such issues.
