The solution depends heavily on the specific native module causing the issue. However, generally, one should explore these options:

**1. Find an Expo-compatible alternative:** Search npm for a package that offers similar functionality and explicitly states compatibility with Expo.  For example, if the original package uses a native camera, see if there's an Expo Camera API that can be used instead.

```javascript
// bug.js (Illustrative example: Attempting to use an incompatible module)
import { someNativeModule } from 'some-incompatible-native-module'; //This will likely cause the error

// ... rest of the code

// bugSolution.js (Illustrative example using Expo Camera API)
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

// ... rest of the code using Expo Camera
```

**2. If no alternative exists, consider using Expo's `expo prebuild` (If applicable):** This might let you use more native modules, but comes with its own complexities.  Follow the Expo documentation carefully.

**3. Eject from Expo (Least preferred):**  Ejecting gives you complete control, but it's a significant change to your project and loses Expo's benefits.  Only do this as a last resort.
